## What is EDTR?

EDTR is a free online notepad and code editor that works directly in your browser. It is inspired by Notepad++ and built for people who want a fast, simple text editor without downloading any software. You can use EDTR to write quick notes, draft documents, edit code snippets, keep to-do lists, or work on any kind of plain text file.

There is no account to create and no sign-up process. You open the website, start typing, and your work is automatically saved to your browser's LocalStorage. If you close the tab or shut down your computer, your notes will still be there when you come back. EDTR does not upload anything to a server. Your data stays on your device at all times.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting
EDTR highlights your code with proper colors as you type. It supports over 20 languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, JSON, Go, Rust, C, C++, Java, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, SQL, Bash, Markdown, YAML, and XML. You can select the language from the status bar at the bottom of the editor.

### Multi-tab Editing
You can open multiple files in separate tabs, just like in Notepad++ or any desktop code editor. Each tab has its own content, language setting, and file name. Use ⌘T to create a new tab and ⌘W to close the current tab.

### Automatic Saving
Your notes are saved automatically to your browser's LocalStorage after every change. You do not need to press a save button. If you close the browser and open EDTR again later, all your tabs and content will be restored exactly as you left them.

### No Login Required
EDTR does not require you to create an account or log in. There are no user accounts, no email verification, and no passwords. You can start using the editor immediately without any sign-up process.

### Open Files From Your Computer
On supported browsers (Chrome, Edge), you can open individual files or entire folders from your local file system using the File System Access API. You can edit these files in the browser and save your changes directly back to disk with ⌘S.

### Works Offline as a PWA
EDTR can be installed as a Progressive Web App. Once installed, it works without an internet connection. You can also set it as the default app for opening text files on your operating system.

### Private and Secure
All your data is stored locally on your device. EDTR does not send your content to any server. There is no tracking, no analytics on your text, and no third-party access to your notes.

### Dark and Light Theme
EDTR supports both dark and light themes. You can switch between them from the editor. The status bar color can also be customized with a built-in color picker.

### Code Formatting
EDTR supports code formatting for JSON files. Press Shift+Alt+F to format your JSON code.

### Word and Character Count
The status bar shows real-time line count, word count, and character count as you type.

### File Export
You can download your files as .txt files using ⌘⇧S. You can also export all your open tabs as a zip file.
